Tntro

  This project shows the progression of three algorithms on the same data.
  Each algorithm will perform one step (one comparison) and 
  the result of this is displayed on a newline.

  This project uses the HTML language, Javascript (JS), and P5.js.

Zip Contents

  x File readme.txt.  This file.

  x File pix.JPG.  A snapshot of the example webpage.

  x File index.html. Drag and drop this into a browser to
    run the example.

  x File assets/p5.js. This is the P5 package.

  x File cs-sketch.js; This contains several P5 user-defined linkage functions
   (setup, draw, keyPressed, and mousePressed), as well as example
    support functions.

  x File assets/styles.css.  This is an extra-small example of controlling
    webpage styling.

  x File assets/draw-stuff.js. This is an example to show loading a JS
    script file from a folder other than the index.html file's
    location.  It also includes the utility draw_grid function written
    in P5+JS.  (Picture "snapped" with the Windows Snip tool.)

Installation & Running

  1. Extract the .zip file into a folder.

  2. Drag the index HTML file, index.html, into a browser
    window.  The example P5 program should start immediately.  You
    should see a 800x480 grid (black lines on white background).  See the
    picture pix-js-p5-example-1.JPG.
